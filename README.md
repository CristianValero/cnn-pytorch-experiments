## cnn-pytorch-experiments

Taco Cohen's experiments are being reproduced in this repository with the aim of continuing this line of study and improving equivariance and invariance in artificial neural networks.

### Results

* P4CNNP4: This is the result of evaluating the P4CNNP4 model with the dataset rotated from -180ยบ to 180ยบ. It can be seen that the rotation invariance is not working properly 
since at angles far from 0ยบ it has a very low hit rate.
